Project Details

Purpose: This dynamic website should provide an easy way to view and compare double up stats. I want the website to compare not just one person’s comps but also their teammate’s comps to figure out what comps go well together.

Why Use My Website: My website will include stats on your teammate’s comp going together with your comp unlike other stat checking sites that only have data on your own comp. The other sites are mainly targeted towards solo queue ranked and don’t display much information about double up.

About Me: I have played TFT since set 6.5 (3 years) I have reached masters in solo queue since set 8.5 peaking GM 450 LP in set 8.5. Since then, I have focused more on double up reaching masters in double up every set since set 8.5 and peaking Challenger 500 LP in set 10 playing simultaneously on two accounts (Kurtain4774 #NA1 on my computer and Pandabear4774 #NA1 on my phone. 

Project Motivation: On my climb, I consistently used sites like metaTFT and tactics.tools to find comps and choose items and augments. However, while these sites showed stats about individual comps, they never had stats about comps that would work well together such as summoner’s rift stats on the best duos. For example if both teammates played a 3 cost reroll comp, this might work better together since they are both rolling for eachother’s units and will hit faster than if they played completely different style comps. 

Target Audience: My target audience is double up players who are competitive about the game and enjoy looking at statistics to get a tactical advantage over their opponents.

Backend Research

Node.js + Express

Backend can access the database and send information to the frontend.



API Research

Can get a lot of summoner data by taking all challenger players and then expanding their games played to get other summoners
