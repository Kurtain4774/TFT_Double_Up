//so we need to first create the mongodb database
//if nothing in the database then
//then we need to add the terms into the database
//else check last time database was updated
//if the last update was over 10 minutes ago, we need to call the riot api and update the database
//and then we need to sort the data and send it back to the frontend
//if we updated recently then we just send the table
//might be a way to do this better though




//also we need to sort the table by rank and then by name after the rank
//we should also have a counter column to keep track of the player's current rank.
